# Who am I and what I do?

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aleksey Kuznetsov, I'm a Software Engineer focused on web technologies and creating accessible UIs.
Besides, I hold a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science â€” software engineering and web technologies, respectively.

## Bio

My path as a developer started back in 2015 when I started to study in ITMO University, St Petersburg, Russia.
As time passed, I've used quite a bit of different programming languages and various technologies.
Later on, I understood that creating and improving user interfaces is something that satisfies me the most and I've started to focus on frontend tools and technologies.
Eventually, I got my first job as a Frontend Engineer back in 2019 after getting my bachelor's degree.

## Tech Stack

I tend to use TypeScript in pretty much every project I develop, unless it's something quick and / or a PoC thing.

Here's a list of technologies I'm somewhat experienced in:

- Programming languages / platforms: JavaScript, Python, Node.js
- Web basics: HTML, CSS
- Styling: SASS, Tailwind
- Frameworks / libraries: React.js, Next.js, Angular
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, CircleCI
- Services: Auth0, Vercel
